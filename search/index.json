Well, anything that piques my interest! Game development, shader breakdowns and programming tutorials are just the tip of the iceberg. I want this site to be something like an open diary of sorts where I can pick at something.\nEnough rambling from me. You\u0026rsquo;re all welcome to the ride so I hope you stick around!\nBelow are my links to see where I am online!\n","date":"2024-03-04T15:07:45-05:00","permalink":"https://wilsoncastillo-blog.netlify.app/p/hello-world/","title":"Hello World!"},{"content":"Hello, welcome to my first official post for my new blog. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with a basic breakdown of data types for Unity scripting. Think of it like a cheat sheet of sorts to check on now and then.\nWith C#, data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold. We\u0026rsquo;re looking through Unity Engine specifically because it uses C# as its primary programming language. Here are some of the basic data types you’ll encounter when scripting. To get started with creating a script, right-click on the project window and click on Create -\u0026gt; C# script.\n# Basic Data Types # Integers 1 int score = 0; An int or integer is a data type that holds a whole number, positive or negative. Important note is that ints cannot be decimals, only whole numbers here.\n# Floats 1 float speed = 5.5f; A float represents a floating-point number, the main difference between an int and a float is that floats can have decimal points. Append an ‘f’ at the end to signal to Unity that it is a float.\n# Booleans 1 bool isJumping = false; A bool or boolean represents a state that can be either true or false.\n# Strings 1 string playerName = \u0026#34;Alex\u0026#34;; A string represents a sequence of characters. For Unity, you might use strings to store names, UI text, currency names or more.\n# Advanced Data Types # Colors 1 Color backgroundColor = Color.red; The Color data type stores values for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha (transparency).\n# Arrays 1 int[] scores; An array is a collection of variables of the same type. You can store multiple values in a single array variable. In Unity, you can add or remove entries of an array within the inspector. Remember, arrays will start with the data entry of 0, not 1.\n# Lists 1 List\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; scores; A List is similar to an array but with additional functionality such as adding and removing elements at runtime.\n# Dictionaries 1 Dictionary\u0026lt;string, int\u0026gt; inventory; A Dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. For example, you might use a dictionary to store an inventory of items, where the item name is the key and the quantity is the value.\n# Vector3 1 Vector3 playerPosition = new Vector3(0, 0, 0); A Vector3 represents a three-dimensional vector, commonly used for positions, directions, and more in 3D space.\n# Protection levels # Public 1 public int score = 0; Public data types are like open fields in your code. Any script when given a reference can access and modify the specified variable directly. You will also see any publicly defined variables within the inspector menu back in Unity.\n# Private 1 private int score = 0; Private data types are exclusive to the script they\u0026rsquo;re declared in. Other scripts can\u0026rsquo;t directly access them. One note is that an effect of a variable becoming private is that it will not appear in the inspector menu back in the Unity Editor.\nThese are just a few of the many different variables you will use when scripting in Unity. If you want a deeper dive into variable types with components, please use the official Unity documentation linked below.\nSources: Unity Docs\n","date":"2024-03-23T12:25:26-04:00","image":"https://wilsoncastillo-blog.netlify.app/post/C/variables.jpg","permalink":"https://wilsoncastillo-blog.netlify.app/p/unity-variable-data-types/","title":"Unity Variable Data Types"}]
