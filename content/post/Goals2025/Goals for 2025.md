### Intro
Hey everyone! Looks like I remembered my password for this website. Just kidding of course, but I did overhaul the workflow to make publishing to this site much easier.

So where have I been. Well for the most part this year I was predominantly a Live Streamer for both [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@WilsonXp) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/thewilsonxp). I made streams mostly relegated to Shiny Hunting in Pokémon games and Lets Plays of various games. 

The TLDR is that I will be back posting here more frequently with more tutorials and general updates on how I’m doing, so I’m treating this website as my professional diary of sorts if that makes any sense.

Here is my goals for 2025

Goals for 2025
- Minimum 3 short form videos per week
- Continue developing tools to bridge the gap between YouTube and Twitch livestreaming
- One Dev channel video per month
- One Main Channel video per month
- Reaching Full Monetization on YouTube
- Release a game. 

### Written
To start off, thank you for making this year pretty good. Started off this year mostly lost in what I wanted to do. I always enjoyed streaming and deep down I knew making something out of this required a lot of work and damn large amount of luck. And at least on Twitch’s side that mostly paid off. The fact anyone wants to watch me is nice and again all I want to say is just, thank you. 

- State of the channel or channels per se.
	- YouTube is going slow, but that’s on me. I spent the past few months experimenting what works and what doesn’t, and I think I have found out the ideal flow of what works for this YouTube channel. Since I am mostly a streamer, how you grow on YouTube is different from lets say an essay channel or daily uploader channel would do. Since your mostly either streaming or cultivating more experiences for your streams it’s hard to find time to put effort in what YouTube thinks is best to grow your channel which is making videos. So you must find a way to make up for that which for me is to do both things; Make stream vods approachable to the average viewer and to create shorts. The latter is imperative to grow if you do not find the time to make videos. Since stream discoverability is still very much dodo water, having shorts to shotgun you way through is so, so important. Of course I'm not one to talk since you know I'm still a pretty small channel but since experiencing decent growth in the past few months I think I'm doing something right you know.
- State of livestreaming
	- The state of livestreaming online is pretty funny, I’d still say that Twitch has the best viewer experience while YouTube has a better* discoverability. That one I'm still hesitant to say because starting a new channel with solely focusing streaming probably won’t get you anywhere. With the advent of vertical streaming that is supposedly a new avenue of getting new viewers to see your stream but with my personal experience I had seen conflicting results. On occasions A does boost live viewership numbers, B. No real difference compared just doing vertical live or normal lives. C. It kind of cannibalizes views, especially since I have this weird bug were I can’t click on a live stream on mobile on my channel tab unless I click my profile picture on YT. So as of now I am just doing normal 16:9 view streams until YouTube sorts that system out.
	- But that’s enough on YT how about Twitch. Honestly the Twitch live-streaming experience has been immaculate despite a few huge UI blenders on the mobile end. Seriously Twitch what are we doing here. But yeah the viewer experience is second to none. Channel point rewards are an amazing system to enhance my streams, it is so good I had to port it to YouTube by using commands. Majority of the code belongs to Haunter handsome gentlemen on screen, and I’ll leave it in the description if anyone wants to use it as well(https://extensions.streamer.bot/t/youtube-points-system-core/223) Also btw I can’t believe we hit Affiliate status so quick! So once again thank you guys seriously! Now I'm not really thinking of pushing to Partner anytime soon, but you never know so we shall see.
- Game development & dev channel.
	- Now you guys may or may not know, but I am a game developer and I won't lie I was slacking hard on that front in 2024. So much so that I am greatly disappointed in myself especially since that was what i went to college for you know. But I will say, I think some parts of game design learnings went into my stream with all the goofy rewards, but I want to go in all in on game making again. 
	- I did create a second developer channel little whiles back but don’t really have anything on it. That’s going to change, I will first upload some shorts tutorials on specific game engines like Unity since that’s my forte. But I want that channel to feature more than tutorials, I want model creations, personal project uploads and more on that channel.
- Goals and expectations for next year
	- I know I didn’t hit my YouTube 250 sub goal by the end of year, but that was expecting a lot TBH especially since I really achieved rapid growth like 2 months ago right?
	- But I want to quadruple down on it. I want 1k subs and FULL monetization for YouTube by the end of 2025. I think next year is my make it or break it year so I can't and won’t slow down now.
	- Now how am I going to do that: 
		- Streams will continue of course but one change; I will be reducing streams from 5 a week to 4 a week. This change is give myself more time for other activities like video editing and game development.
		- I will keep up pace with shorts with having a short every other day so around 3-4 per week.
		- And have at least one main channel video per month. January’s video is the Yoshi Island Experience, compiling the entire Yoshi island walkthrough I did on stream.
		- But how can I encourage more subs on YT, I got some goals.
		- When I hit 250 subs, I will stream myself doing 250 matches in Splatoon 3 with whichever is the worst weapon you guys pick in chat.
		- For 500 subs, I will stream myself completing the 200cc Time Trails for Mario Kart 8 Booster Course Pass DLC for the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe game for the Nintendo Switch family of systems.
		- For 750 and 1k, well I haven’t decided yet, comment down below to give me suggestions please.
	- Now as for the development channel;
		- I want the channel to be active as well, again at least one video per month on that channel, but I will be more loose on what will be uploaded. Sometimes it will be shorts, other times it will be speed modeling, sometimes it will be tutorials. 
	- For Twitch and for live streams as well. Well there really isn’t much I want to change. I think we have a good thing going with shiny hunting and lets plays. Would I want to very things up from time to time, sure, but I think we’re on the right track. I want to create more channel rewards and ways to make streams more interactive so look forward to that.
	- Down the line when I am able to and feel comfortable. Expand streams to either earlier or later in the day for game dev work. Like creating 3d models in **Blender** or coding whatnot.
	- Last but not least, I want to release a game. I want to make and release something that I can say, damn I made that, hell yeah. I have the skills, I just need to do it. 
	- Is it a lot of goals and expectations. Absolutely. But I work best under pressure, I think I can do it. Let’s make 2025 a year to remember, hope you all will be there for the ride. Take care of yourselves and hope you all have a lively rest of your day, see ya!
