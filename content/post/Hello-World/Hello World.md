Hello, this is my new blog site! This will be the source where I will be posting several pieces of content freely available online. What will be discussed here? Well, anything that piques my interest! Game development, shader breakdowns and programming tutorials are just the tip of the iceberg. I want this site to be something like an open diary of sorts where I can pick at something.

Enough rambling from me. You're all welcome to the ride so I hope you stick around!

Below are my links to see where I am online!
